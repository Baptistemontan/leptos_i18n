# Introduction

This book is intended as an introduction to the [Leptos_i18n](https://github.com/Baptistemontan/leptos_i18n) crate.

This crate is made to simplify Internationalization in a [Leptos](https://crates.io/crates/leptos) application that loads locales at **_compile time_** and provides compile-time checks for translation keys, interpolation keys, and the selected locale.

This guide does assume you know some basics about `Leptos`, but the majority of the guide is about declaring the translations and how to use them. You can find the `Leptos` book [here](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/).

> The source code for the book is available [here](https://github.com/Baptistemontan/leptos_i18n/tree/master/docs/book). PRs for typos or clarification are always welcome.
